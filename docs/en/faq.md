## Why is `full` mode not supported when using the MyAnimeList API?

Due to the limitations of the MyAnimeList API, it is not possible to get complete information about the anime, including the introduction, number of episodes, ratings, broadcast date, etc. required in the `full` mode. Therefore, it is currently not possible to enable the `full` mode when using the MyAnimeList API.  
If you want to use the `full` mode, you can try using the Bangumi API.
